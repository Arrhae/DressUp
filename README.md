# DressUp
Expansion for World of Warcraft item preview/dressing room.

## Description
The Dressing Room Extraordinaire! DressUp extends the default functionality of the dressing room feature to give you more control over previewing your character.

DressUp adds buttons to display currently previewed items and allows you to hide items you don't want to preview by right clicking the item icon or undress all. You can also preview your character with different race and gender, switch the default background of preview screen to something else and dim it. Lastly by default the clunky and small side dressing room panel that is displayed when previewing items from the Auction House or Void Storage is switched to the fully fledged dressing room. This feature can be disabled but the side dressing room panel will not have the aforementioned features.

The addon also extends the character info panel. Holding alt key while character info panel is open will display the item level of equipped items.

### Usage
DressUp will automatically load when previewing items on your character. The few options you can change are found by clicking the cogwheel icon in the bottom left corner of the dressing room window.

To change the background hold Control and scroll using mouse wheel while keeping mouse over the dressing room window. If you press middle mouse button while holding Control key the background will be changed to a featureless one.

## Dependencies
DressUp uses Ace3 which is included in the /libs directory.
